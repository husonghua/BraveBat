This is an **unofficial** API for Brave Browser verified creators. We are a fan of Brave Browser and BAT. The source data comes from https://publishers-distro.basicattentiontoken.org/api/v3/public/channels (big file alert!), which we sync our data with daily. To use this API, you need to register an account with us at https://bravebat.info/register. This API is free to use, but we reserve the right to rate-limit your usage if you excessively use the API (currently at 60 API calls per minute). You are required to display the message “Powered by BraveBat” that links to https://bravebat.info somewhere prominently in your app or service. Be Brave and thank you!
