This is an **unofficial** API for Brave Browser verified creators. We are a fan of Brave Browser and BAT. The source data comes from https://publishers-distro.basicattentiontoken.org/api/v3/public/channels (big file alert!), which we sync our data with daily. To use this API, you need to register an account with us [here](/register). If you have account already, please login [here](/login) and generate an API token. This API is free to use, but we reserve the right to rate-limit your usage if you excessively use the API (currently at 60 API calls per minute). You are required to make a backlink to https://bravebat.info in your app or service with a link text like "Powered by BraveBat", "Data from BraveBat", etc. Be Brave and thank you!
