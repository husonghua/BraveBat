This is an **unofficial** API for Brave Browser verified creators. We are a fan of Brave Browser and BAT. The source data comes from https://publishers-distro.basicattentiontoken.org/api/v3/public/channels (big file alert!), which we sync our data with daily. We also use other third-party API data to enrich the data.

To use this API, you need to register an account with us [here](/register). If you have an account already, please log in [here](/login) and get an API token. This API requires an API token and is free to use, but we reserve the right to rate-limit your usage if you excessively use the API (currently at 60 API calls per minute). You are required to make a backlink to https://bravebat.info in your app or service with an anchor text to the effect of "Powered by BraveBat", "Data from BraveBat", etc. If you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at bravebatinfo@gmail.com.

The API is currrently on V1. There are currently a few limitations:

1. The Reddit endpoint currently only returns true/false answer without additional datapoints.
2. The YouTube endpoint currently does not have additional datapoints for all verified creators.

Be Brave and thank you!
