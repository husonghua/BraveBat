        <p class="pt-4">
            BraveBat is not in the business of making money off your data, and we do not serve ads. Everything we
            collect is used exclusively to help us provide you with the best service possible.

            Identity & Access
        </h2>
        <p class="pt-4">
            When you sign up for BraveBat, we ask for your name and email address. That’s just so you can personalize
            your new account. We’ll never sell or rent your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name
            or company in marketing statements without your permission, either.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
            When you contact BraveBat with a question or to ask for help, we’ll keep that correspondence, and the email
            address, for future reference. When you browse our marketing pages, we’ll track that for statistical
            purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like
            surveys, for as long as it makes sense.
        </p>

            BraveBat won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out

            All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. Data isn’t encrypted
            while it’s live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to
            great lengths to secure your data at rest.
